Currently, this code grabs lists of courses offered per term per subject.

The goal is to have an HTML scraper using PHP that retrieves book information for UWaterloo courses and saves them in a .csv file.

The reason for grabbing lists of courses is to minimize the amount of calls we make to the UWaterloo Bookstore.
